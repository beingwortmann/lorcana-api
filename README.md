## Overview

This project is a fan-driven tool that automatically downloads, processes, and organizes the card catalog data and images for Lorcana TCG. It retrieves the latest JSON data and images, structures them by language and resolution, updates a SQLite database, and pushes the changes via GitHub Actions. This ensures that your repository always reflects the most recent catalog update.

---

## Features

- **Automated Data Retrieval:**  
  Downloads the latest card catalog from the Lorcana API.

- **Data Processing & Database Update:**  
  Extracts key fields from the JSON files (such as name, subtitle, rules text, identifiers, and more) and updates a SQLite database.

- **Image Download & Organization:**  
  Retrieves card images in multiple resolutions and organizes them into language-specific directories, including special folders for foil masks.

- **Scheduled & Manual Updates:**  
  Integrated with GitHub Actions to run on a schedule as well as manually via the GitHub Actions interface.

- **Dynamic Last Updated Display:**  
  The badges at the top show the time of the last commit, giving a visual indicator of when the data was last updated.
