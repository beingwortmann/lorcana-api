If I play a Zero to Hero and then shift a Cinderella - Stouthearted onto my Cinderella - Knight in Training can that Cinderella - Stouthearted challenge ready characters that turn?\r\n\r\nA: No. Cinderella - Stoutheartedâ€™s ability is a trigger ability that happens when you play a song. If Cinderella - Stouthearted is not in play when you play a song card she will not be able to challenge even if she is played later in the turn."
