If I move Peter Pan to De Vil Manor – Cruella’s Estate, which has 1 {L}, and then move him back to The Queen’s Castle, can I use his I Came to Listen to the Stories ability to gain 2 lore?\r\nA: No. You must use Peter Pan – Lost Boy Leader’s ability I Came to Listen to the Stories the first time he moves to a location each turn. If he hasn’t moved on your turn and you move him to De Vil Manor, you gain 1 lore. You can’t use his I Came to Listen to the Stories ability again that turn.\r\n"
