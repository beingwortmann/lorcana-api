If multiple effects of yours happen at the same time during your turn, you choose the order in which they occur, then resolve the effects in that order. After that, each other player resolves their effects in turn, starting with the player to your left.\r\n\r\nExample: If you have Dr. Facilier – Agent Provocateur in play and your Gramma Tala – Storyteller is challenged and banished, you choose whether to return the Gramma Tala card to your hand or put it into your inkwell.\r\n"
