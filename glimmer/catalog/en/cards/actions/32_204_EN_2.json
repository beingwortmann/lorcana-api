In this case can I play a character from my hand that costs 5 ink for free using the ability of Zero to Hero?\r\n\r\nA: Due to the effect of Zero to Hero you pay 10 less ink to play the next character you play. If that character costs equal to or less than 10 then you play it for free (you do not exert any ink to play it). Note that even in the above instance you may only reduce the cost of a single character. Even if you have 10 characters in play when you play Zero to hero you may not play 2 5 cost characters for free, just 1 character that costs 10 or less free or a character that costs more than 10 for 10 less than their printed cost.\r\n"
