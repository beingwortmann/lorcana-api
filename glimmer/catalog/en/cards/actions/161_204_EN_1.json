This does NOT apply to actions that are part of a cost.\r\n\r\nExample: Develop Your Brain says “Look at the top 2 cards of your deck. Put one into your hand and the other on the bottom of the deck.” If you only have one card left in your deck, you look at that card and then put it in your hand.\r\n"
