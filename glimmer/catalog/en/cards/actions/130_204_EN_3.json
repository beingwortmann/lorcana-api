Now! affects all of your characters that are in play for each of its effects. First it will ready them and deal 1 damage to each of them. Those with Resist +1 will reduce that damage by 1 before any damage is dealt to them and receive no damage. All your characters will be unable to quest the rest of the turn, even if they were ready when On Your Feet! Now! was played and even if they didnâ€™t receive damage from it. \r\n"
