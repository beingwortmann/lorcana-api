If I play A Whole New World and draw 7 cards, can I move all 4 damage counters from Beast to Flounder using Maleficent’s Divination ability?\r\nA: No. You may use Maleficent’s Divination ability every time you draw a card. If you draw multiple cards at the same time, you have that many opportunities to use the ability. After you move 2 damage counters to Flounder, who has 2 {W}, he’ll be banished. Note that when you use Maleficent’s Divination ability while there are no opposing characters in play, you won’t be able to move any damage counters, so the ability will resolve without doing anything.\r\n"
