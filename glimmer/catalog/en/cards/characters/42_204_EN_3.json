Exerting a character is the cost to have that character sing a song, so Jafar will already be exerted when the effect of Friends on the Other Side has you draw 2 cards.\r\n\r\nQ: During my turn, I exerted my Jafar – Striking Illusionist to quest with him. When I draw a card at the beginning of my next turn, do I gain 1 lore from Jafar’s ability Power Beyond Measure?\r\nA: No. The first thing players do at the beginning of their turn is ready their exerted cards. By the time you draw a card at the start of your turn, Jafar will be ready and you won’t be able to use his Power Beyond Measure ability until he’s exerted again.\r\n"
