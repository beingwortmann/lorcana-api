How much damage will Flynn Rider take from the challenge, considering Jafar’s ability Hidden Wonders?\r\nA: You use Flynn Rider – Charming Rogue’s Here Comes the Smolder ability as soon as he’s chosen for an opposing character’s challenge. This means the challenging player must discard a card before any damage from the challenge is dealt to either character. In this case, you’ll have to discard 1 of your 2 cards, so you’ll have 1 card left. Jafar – Keeper of Secret’s ability increases his Strength by the amount equal to the number of cards in your hand, so Jafar will have 1 Strength when he deals damage to Flynn Rider.\r\n"
