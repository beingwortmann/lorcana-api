When choosing which character to banish with the Power to Rule at last ability what characters can be chosen?\r\n\r\nA: Even though Lady Tremaine is your character your opponent chooses which character to banish with her effect. This means that despite Prince Johnâ€™s ward he can be chosen to be banished by the effect and therefore your opponent can choose either of their characters to banish for the Power to Rule at Last ability."
