When I quest with Magica De Spell – The Midas Touch, how much lore do I gain?\r\nA: When you quest with Magica De Spell – The Midas Touch, her All Mine ability has you pick one of your items and gain lore equal to its cost. Because Magica has 0 {L}, you don’t gain any lore from her quest itself, only from her ability. So in this example you can choose to gain either 1 or 7 lore.\r\n"
