Do I gain lore from her ability Do You Know Who You Are?\r\nA: No. You can only use Gramma Tala – Spirit of the Ocean’s Do You Know Who You Are? ability if she’s in play when a card is put into your inkwell. When a character in play is put into a player’s inkwell, the character first leaves play and then is put into the inkwell. This means Gramma Tala isn’t in play to see a card being put into your inkwell, so you can’t use her ability. Note that this is still the case if Gramma Tala was shifted and there’s a card underneath her.\r\n"
