If my Jafar- Keeper of Secrets challenges my opponent’s Stitch- New Dog and I use the Let the Games Begin ability of my Queen of Hearts, how much damage does Stitch take from the challenge?\r\n\r\nA: 2 damage. Queen of Hearts- Sensing Weakness’ Let the Games Begin ability applies as soon as a challenge is declared, before the challenge itself has happened. This means that when the challenge occurs Jafar- Keeper of Secrets will see that you have 2 cards in hand and will gain 2 strength total from his Hidden Wonders ability."
