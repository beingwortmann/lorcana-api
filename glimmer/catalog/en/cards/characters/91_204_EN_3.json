You can’t wait until later in the turn.\r\n\r\nQ: The only character in play is my Ursula – Deceiver of All, who currently has 1 damage. If I have Ursula sing Let the Storm Rage On, can I use her What a Deal ability to play it again?\r\nA: Yes. When you play Let the Storm Rage On, if there’s a character in play you can choose to deal 2 damage to, you must do so. Even if Let the Storm Rage on banishes your Ursula – Deceiver of All, you can still use her What a Deal ability. In this case you won’t be able to deal 2 damage to a character, as there aren’t any in play, but you still draw a card.\r\n\r\nQ: My Ursula – Deceiver of All sings The Boss is On a Roll. I choose to place 4 cards on top of my deck and 1 card on the bottom. If I use her What a Deal ability to play The Boss is On a Roll again and choose to put 1 more card on the bottom of my deck, where does my copy of The Boss is On a Roll go in relation to the other cards I placed on the bottom of my deck?\r\nA: The Boss is On a Roll will be the bottom-most card of your deck, regardless of how many cards you put on the bottom of your deck each time you played it. The card played a second time with Ursula – Deceiver of All’s ability What a Deal is placed on the bottom of your deck after its effect has finished.\r\n"
