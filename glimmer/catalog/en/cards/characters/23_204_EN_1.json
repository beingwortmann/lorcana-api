If I use Lantern so I can pay 1 {I} less to play that character, can I then exert them to draw a card?\r\n\r\nA: It’s not the cost of the character you play that’s reduced by Lantern; it’s the amount you have to pay. The new character’s cost would still be 3, so they wouldn’t qualify to be a fan of Stitch.\r\n"
