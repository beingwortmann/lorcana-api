If I shift a second copy of Minnie Mouse Wide-Eyed Diver onto the first copy of Minnie Mouse- Wide-Eyed Diver. How much lore would that new Wide-Eyed Diver have?\r\n\r\nA: 3 lore. It has 1 lore base and has gained 2 lore from the ability of the first copy of Wide-Eyed Diver’s Undersea Adventure ability. The lore gained from that ability remains even if the character shifts. The ability of the second copy of Wide-Eyed Diver does not add to it’s total lore because it was not in play when you played your second action so it’s ability does not trigger."
